# About the Graph Algorithms Book

Could the patent on a single graph algorithm really be worth 350 million dollars?  Yes, it can!

When Larry Page was a student at
Stanford he created the PageRank algorithm for predicting how high a page should be ranked in a search result.  The patent, which was owned by Stanford was licensed to Google for stock.  When Google went public the stock was valued at $350 million!

This story is just one example of why graph algorithms are relevant to modeling the world around us.  In the graph community, we have the expression *"graphs are everywhere."*  This statement reflects the fact that graph data models, particularly the [labeled property graph](./glossary.md#labeled-property-graph) model.
