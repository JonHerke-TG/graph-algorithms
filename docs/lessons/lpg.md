# Native Labeled Property Graphs

Native labeled property graphs are a specific type of data structure used primarily in graph databases. They are designed to efficiently store and query data that is inherently graph-like, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and other complex interconnected data.

## What are Native Labeled Property Graphs?

-   **Structure:** These graphs are composed of nodes and edges (relationships). Each node and edge can have a label that defines its type or role. Additionally, both nodes and edges can possess a set of properties (key-value pairs) that hold relevant data.

-   **Native Storage:** The term "native" implies that the data is stored in a way that naturally fits a graph structure. Unlike non-native graph storage, native graph databases are optimized for traversability.

-   **Traversal Using Pointers:** In native labeled property graphs, nodes and edges are usually stored in such a way that they contain direct references (pointers) to adjacent nodes and edges. This makes traversing the graph (i.e., moving from one node to its connected nodes) highly efficient.

## Implementation with Pointer Traversal

-   **Pointer-based Storage:** Each node in the graph has pointers that directly reference its neighboring nodes or connected edges. Similarly, edges point back to the nodes they connect.

-   **Efficiency in Traversal:** This direct referencing allows for fast and efficient traversal operations, as the database can quickly navigate through the graph structure without needing to perform expensive search operations.

-   **Optimization for Graph Operations:** This method is particularly optimized for typical graph operations like finding shortest paths, neighbors, or specific patterns within the graph.

## Comparison to RDBMS Storage of Graphs

-   **RDBMS Approach:** In a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS), graphs are often stored in tables, with separate tables for nodes and edges. Relationships are established using foreign keys.

-   **Performance Issues:** This approach can be less performant for graph operations because:

    -   **Join Operations:** Traversing the graph typically requires multiple join operations between tables, which can be computationally expensive, especially for large and complex graphs.
    -   **Non-Native Structure:** Relational databases are not inherently designed for graph-like queries, leading to inefficiencies in handling deeply connected data.
-   **Scalability Concerns:** As the size and complexity of the graph grow, the performance of RDBMS in handling graph operations tends to degrade more rapidly compared to native graph databases.

In summary, native labeled property graphs are optimized for graph data and operations, offering significant performance benefits, especially for complex and deeply interconnected datasets. They are contrasted with RDBMS systems, which, while versatile, often struggle with the demands of graph processing due to their non-native handling of graph structures and reliance on join operations.
